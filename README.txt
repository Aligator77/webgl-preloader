This is a template for WebGL-based Unity games. It includes a simple preloader, the script required to connect to the Kongregate API through Unity, and removes any extra buffer space around the game window.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Place the "Kong Preloader" folder into a "WebGLTemplates" folder in your assets. In the WebGL player settings window, there should now be an option to use it as the template when building your game. That's it! All done.
